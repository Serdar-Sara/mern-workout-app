app.use(express.json())

It is a middleware in Express.js that parses incoming JSON data from HTTP requests.

What Does It Do?
Parses JSON Bodies: When a client sends JSON data in the request body (e.g., in a POST or PUT request),
this middleware converts the raw JSON string into a JavaScript object.
Attaches to req.body: The parsed JSON data becomes accessible in your route handlers via req.body.

When to Use It
Use this middleware when your API expects to receive JSON data in the request body. Common scenarios:
REST APIs: Handling POST/PUT requests (e.g., submitting forms, updating data).
Frontend Frameworks: When using React, Angular, or Vue, which often send JSON data to the backend.
Mobile Apps: Mobile clients (iOS/Android) sending JSON payloads.

Summary
What: Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.
When: For APIs expecting JSON data (POST/PUT/PATCH requests).
Why: To access req.body easily and avoid manual parsing.
How: Add app.use(express.json()) before your routes.

How Node.js Resolves Paths
If the path starts with ./ → Node.js looks in the same directory.
If the path starts with ../ → Node.js moves one folder up.  (bir adım geri git öyle bak demek)
If the path does not start with . or / → Node.js assumes it's a built-in module or looks in node_modules.
